# Base class for events caused by the action of a user on a GUI. Generally assumed
# to be doing something on a particular widget, and being named explicitly by the
# programmer in some language domain.

# Record scripts will call shouldRecord and will not record anything if this
# returns false: this is to allow for widgets with state which may not necessarily
# have changed in an appopriate way just because of the signal. They will then call outputForScript
# and write this to the script

# Replay scripts will call generate in order to simulate the event over again.
