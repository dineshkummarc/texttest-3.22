> setenv INSTALLATION_DIR <my_installation_directory>
> setenv SOURCE_DIR <my_source_directory>

Unless otherwise indicated, the procedure for building a package is as follows:

> cd $SOURCE_DIR
> tar zvxf package-1.2.3.tar.gz
> cd package-1.2.3
> ./configure --prefix=$INSTALLATION_DIR
> make
> make install

1. Build Glib 2.22
==================

Do the above with glib-2.22.5.tar.gz
On e.g. RHEL4 you'll also need to build your own pkg-config, suggest pkg-config-0.21.tar.gz

2. Set up environment
=====================

Now, to make sure the build system finds our newly installed glib (and other packages, as we continue), set

> setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH ${INSTALLATION_DIR}/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/lib/pkgconfig
> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $INSTALLATION_DIR/lib/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
> setenv PATH ${INSTALLATION_DIR}/bin:${PATH}

We include /usr/lib/pkgconfig in the config path since on our system libxml-2.0 is installed in /usr/lib.
On 64-bit systems this may well need to be /usr/lib64/pkgconfig instead. Check for the existence of
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/libxml-2.0.pc and /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libxml-2.0.pc if unsure.

3. Build GTK+ 2.18. 
===================

That means the following packages, in this order

fontconfig-2.8.0.tar.gz
pixman-0.16.6.tar.gz
cairo-1.8.10.tar.gz
atk-1.28.0.tar.gz
pango-1.26.2.tar.gz
gtk+-2.18.9.tar.gz

# (Note that on SuSE you may need cups-devel installed for the last package, see the note in overview.txt)

4. Build PyGTK 2.16.
====================

Now we're integrating with Python. That means you need python-devel installed if you haven't done so already.
It also means that if you want these packages to work with a non-standard Python, you should make sure that the correct Python
is first in your PATH, i.e. set

> setenv PATH /path/to/python/binary:${PATH}

Build the packages in this order:

py2cairo-1.8.10.tar.gz
pygobject-2.20.0.tar.gz
pygtk-2.16.0.tar.gz

5. Install a nice theme
=======================
Well, that's optional, but the default theme often looks quite ugly. I recommend
installing Clearlooks:

clearlooks-0.6.2.tar.bz2

You can then change your theme by adding a file at $INSTALLATION_DIR/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
with the contents

gtk-theme-name = "Clearlooks"
gtk-icon-theme-name = "Clearlooks"
