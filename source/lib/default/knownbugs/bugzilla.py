# Plugin for bugzilla version 3.x that uses the new webservice interface. Tested for version 3.0.4
# but tried to make it a bit future-proof. The older "bugcli" interface is discontinued but there is
# a plugin for it too, see bugzillav2.py. Documentation can be found at e.g.
# http://www.astrogrid.org/bugzilla/docs/html/api/

# The webservice interface is still fairly primitive, there is for example no way to extract the initial
# comment. But at least it's officially part of bugzilla so will hopefully hang around for longer than
# bugcli did, and there are clearly plans to move it forward.
