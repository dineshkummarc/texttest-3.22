auto_collapse_successful:1

# For this test, we want the failure and success colors to be the same, 
# to test how the collapse code reacts to this, since it bases collapsing
# on the color of the 'details' column. Thus, this should collapse even 
# failed suites, which really isn't correct, but which is the current behaviour.
# Obviously, the example might be a bit contrieved, but it is good to highlight 
# the fact that the code currently doesn't work perfectly under all circumstances.
