Sometimes we remove line number 2...

Sometimes we remove today's date, 2003-12-01T23:24

We need to be able to match on trailing spaces 
 and also on leading spaces

Or even several lines at once, like in this table:
   Here     are     some     columns
   That    have    spacing   between
Repeating     3     3     3     3

Sometimes between markers, starting section
Rant
Rave Horribly
Gibber Horribly
End Section Here

This should always go: "<test write directory>"
