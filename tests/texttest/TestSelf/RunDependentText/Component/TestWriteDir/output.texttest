I wrote a file in <writedir> today.
And on Windows, I wrote one called <writedir> as well.
But the default location on Windows has spaces in it, like <writedir>
And you can even get them on the same line, like "<writedir>" and "<writedir>"
I set a variable file=<writedir>
And quoted it a bit "<writedir>".
