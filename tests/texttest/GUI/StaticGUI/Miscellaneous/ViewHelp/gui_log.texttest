CHANGES IN DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR (OR PROCEDURE)
=========================================================

(1) Scripts that use batch session parameters
=============================================
There are several scripts which apply to batch mode data. These are

batch.ArchiveRepository
batch.CollectFiles (deprecated)
batch.GenerateGraphs
batch.GenerateSummaryPage

All of these have had some way of referring to the batch session, usually as a script parameter (with different names for each). These are now removed. To supply the batch session for all of these, do it in the normal way, i.e. with the -b parameter. So for example

texttest -s "batch.CollectFiles session=nightjob"

will no longer work, and should now be done via

texttest -s batch.CollectFiles -b nightjob

========== GtkTextView ==========
(1) Due to resurrected support on Windows, the configuration 'unixConfig'
is no longer present or necessary. The few UNIX-specific things left
are inferrred by running the configuration 'default' on a UNIX system.

In other words, if your config file says
config_module:unixConfig

delete this line.

(2) This applies to anyone who was tried to measure CPU time or memory consumption
with texttest. The config file format of most settings has changed.

Because any number of resource-related files can now be extracted, the settings are 
now more like the batch settings, each is a section, with type names. So, for example,
instead of

performance_test_resource:model=Opteron250

you would now write

[performance_test_resource]
cputime:model=Opteron250

Likewise, minimum_cputime_for_test and minimum_memory_for_test are replaced by

[performance_test_minimum]
cputime:10
memory:5

The name 'cputime' for UNIX time-generated CPU time is hardcoded. The rest you can 
set yourself. Use the entry

[performance_logfile_extractor]
memory:Memory Usage Is

to tell TextTest how to create the file from your log file. (This replaces 'string_before_memory'.) The file name 'memory' no longer has any special meaning.

There is also a new entry, that can tell it to use a file other than the one indicated by log_file
for this purpose: as follows.

[performance_logfile]
memory:output

In summary, the changes are follows:

Old names                               New Names
=========                               =========
performance_test_machine (list)         performance_test_machine (section)
performance_test_resource (list)        performance_test_resource (section)
<cputime|memory>_variation_% (int)      performance_variation_% (section)
minimum_<cputime|memory>_for_test (int) performance_test_minimum (section)
string_before_memory (string)           performance_logfile_extractor (section)

Note for migrators (or checkers): check your sections end correctly. If you have global level 
settings after a section, an [end] marker will be needed to make sure that they don't end up 
in the section! Otherwise they will not be included.

(example)

[performance_test_machine]
cputime:apple

config_module:default

(This will not work as config_module will be entered in the section [performance_test_machine]. Use an [end] marker after the section.)

System requirements (see Migration Notes):
General GUI Enhancements:
    - File selection is now preserved when a new test is selected
	Makes it easier to compare previews of different test results
    - Window naming changed
	Main aim is to put differentiating info at the start to aid finding in window managers
Static GUI Enhancements:
    - Version information now shown when a single test/suite with extra versions selected
	Previously hard to tell which was selected
    - GUI testing for Swing - PyUseCase 3.6 replaces defunct JUseCase in application creation dialog
Dynamic GUI Enhancements:
    - New option "<full version>" in "version to save" in Save As dialog
	Basically save with the full version you ran with, as was default behaviour in TextTest 3.20
	Particularly helpful when running multiple versions
    - Recomputed completed tests always reloads config file, even if other tests still running
	Threading-related issues fixed.
    - When a file-related row is selected in the status view, select equivalent files in the test file view
	Note changes behaviour of "Save" in this situation
    - Settings of $TEXTTEST_CHECKOUT and $TEXTTEST_CHECKOUT_NAME now listed in Run Info tab
	Also made it easier for configurations to configure what appears there
Framework Enhancements:
    - Added possibility to configure copying procedure for test data files
	See docs for "copy_test_path_script".
    - Now support GUI testing on separate networks
	Both virtual display and accessibility of usecase and UI map files fixed
Batch Report Enhancements:
    - If a date is used as the name, use that throughout instead of the actual date to identify the run
    - Junit format report now assumes locale encoding instead of hardcoding UTF-8
    - Junit format includes times when performance enabled
    - HTML pages link all graphs at the top so they can be seen at once, if there is more than one graph on the page
    - Made it easier for configurations to override how batch sessions are defined - single API function for it
	Caused some backwards compatibility changes for scripts - see migration notes
Grid Engine (LSF/SGE) enhancements/bug fixes:
    - Fixed stacktrace when normal polling cannot find a job, e.g. if SGE master goes down
    - Fixed stacktrace in slave when test names contain colons
    - Recomputing after a status update in SGE no longer duplicates progress information
    - Now handles hold state (hqw) correctly
    - Fixed hang if slave gets an invalid test for any reason
Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed inconsistencies in dynamic GUI with test suite "all succeeded" status when tests are recomputed and then fail.
    - Fixed stacktrace trying to build piecharts when matplotlib not installed
    - Make sure options after positional arguments get treated as arguments to the new program
    - Allow linking of executable, which is done in the new rpm (thanks Michael Behrisch)
    - Record/Add dialog sizes improved
    - Focus in dialogs with file choosers (like the application creation one) now starts at the top
    - Command lines with empty string arguments now shown correctly in Run Info
    - On POSIX platforms, tests that set LANG and change encoding will no longer cause errors from TextTest previews
    - Fixed occasional stacktraces when viewing files in tests exactly as the test in question completes
    - Tried to improve handling of errors from "ps" on POSIX systems
    - Fixed bug where invalid names of saved selections persist even after being changed
    - Fixed stacktrace replacing text in files if the pattern matches a directory

========== GtkTextView ==========
Framework enhancements:
    - Plugin scripts (-s option) will no longer be rejected by the framework if no tests are found (engine.py)
	- sometimes they only act on the application anyway.
    - A couple of config file defaults changed: 
	"view_program" now defaults to "emacs" rather than "xemacs" on UNIX, as it is slightly more universally available
	"slow_motion_replay_speed" defaults to 3 instead of 0 (this was more or less a bug)
LSF/SGE enhancements:
    - Unrunnable tests will always report the machine they run on (engine.py)
	Previously some "hard" failures could cause the machine not to be reported
    - performance_test_resource entry now works when machine names in SGE are 'short' (sge.py)
	Previously it only worked if the full domain name was in SGE.
    - If tests report as running but then get terminated hard (e.g. SIGKILL), report them as "killed" (queuesystem.py)
	Previously reported confusingly as "abandoned" - but there was nothing to abandon
    - Finding information in older accounting files in SGE now works (sge.py)
	There has been code lying around to do this for some time but it's never worked until now...
Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed crash on removing tests after starting static GUI from scratch (texttestgui.py,testmodel.py)
	Showed up if the GUI was started with only a config file available.
    - Removing last test from a test suite now removes it from the GUI display also (texttestgui.py)
    - Test completion time on progress bar is now always correct (texttestgui.py)
	It tended to update itself to the current time when clicking around...
    - Collation of files to names containing "." characters is now forbidden (default.py)
	It violates TextTest's naming conventions and hence causes trouble
    - 'Text Info' and 'Viewing' tabs now always appear in the same order (guiplugins.py)
	Viewing tests that were pending in SGE/LSF could cause them to switch before.
    - No longer show spurious files in the static GUI if full temporary path contains "." characters (testmodel.py)
    - External viewers can be started even if the path to the file contains spaces (guiplugins.py)
    - If the script for interpreting core files on UNIX fails, it no longer causes a TextTest crash (predict.py)
    - Fixed crash when an extra_version is rejected for a batch run via batch_version (engine.py)
    - Test data identified by environment variables can now be used as keys in "test_data_searchpath" (default.py)
    - Disable interactive dialogue in console interface after ^C has been pressed (respond.py)
Test Fixes:
    - A certain amount of work done stablising the self-tests and reducing the probability of occasional failures, 
      particularly the tests for SGE/LSF.

========== GtkTextView ==========
Some features are easiest to understand by example. For complete newcomers to TextTest it's recommended
to follow the "Getting Started" tutorial and then possibly the "Course Material" which can be seen at
http://www.texttest.org/index.php?page=documentation_trunk. For those who basically know the tool but
want to explore features they haven't used, the self-tests provide a wealth of working examples.

These can be found in the download, or the latest version of them can be had from source control.
See http://www.texttest.org/index.php?page=download.

There are various "TargetApp" directories to be found under it. Each of these contains a test-suite 
for a simple program (which are in turn part of the larger test suite for TextTest, as it tests 
itself testing these programs)

To run these apps by hand, you can view and run them in TextTest:

1) Set the environment variable STANDARD to point at the "standard" file at the top level of the self-tests
2) texttest -d <path to TargetApp> -gx  

What there is to find (below is just a selection):

TargetApp                                  : used by default as it's very basic, this test suite has
                                               one test (that fails) on a "Hello World" program.

TestSelf/TestSelection/TargetApp           : Contains a few tests with related names, to explore the
                                               functionality for selecting tests and saving those selections.

TestSelf/ChangeTestResults/TargetApp       : Contains a few tests that fail in various ways, to explore
                                               how these are reported and how the results can be saved.

TestSelf/RunDependentText/TargetApp        : useful for understanding the run-dependent text filtering

TestSelf/EnvironmentFile/TargetApp         : useful for understanding how environment variables are 
                                               set and unset

TestSelf/DiagnosticHandling/TargetApp      : useful for understanding integration with log4py, log4j
